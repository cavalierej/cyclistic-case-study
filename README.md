# Introduction
This case study is the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate. It will focus on Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, and I will act as a junior data analyst helping to solve a business problem. I will be following the data analysis steps outlined in the certificate: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. The overarching question to explore is: **How do casual users and members use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

# Background
## Cyclistic
Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Most riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno (the director of marketing) believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. 

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. To do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Scenario
I am assuming the role of a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic. My manager, Moreno, believes that the company’s future success relies on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team needs to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, a marketing strategy will be devised to convert casual riders into members. Cyclistic executives will need to approve any recommendations made, and they must be backed up with compelling data insights and visualizations.

I will be using “Guiding Questions” and “Key Tasks” as taught in the certificate courses to help complete my analysis at each step of the data analysis steps outlined earlier. 

# Ask
Three questions will guide the future marketing program: 
1.	How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
2.	Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
3.	How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members? 

I will be focusing on answering the first question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

### Guiding Questions
•	What is the problem you are trying to solve?
•	How can your insights drive business decisions?
### Key Tasks
•	Identify the business task
•	Consider key stakeholders
 
**Business Task:**

I will be using 1 year of Cyclistic’s ridership data to gather insights to inform a marketing plan that aims to convert casual users into members. This plan will be developed by my team, my manager, and will be presented to executives for approval.
